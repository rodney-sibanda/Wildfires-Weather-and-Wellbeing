# Wildfires, Weather, and Wellbeing: An Analysis of Factors Influencing Air Quality

Wildfires have become an increasingly visible and disruptive consequence of climate change in Canada, particularly in Alberta, where rising temperatures and prolonged dry conditions have intensified both the frequency and severity of fire seasons. Beyond environmental damage, wildfire activity poses serious risks to air quality and public health, as smoke and fine particulate matter can travel long distances and persist well beyond the duration of a fire event.

This project examines the interconnected relationship between weather patterns, wildfire activity, air pollution, and respiratory health outcomes across Alberta, with a particular focus on how changing climate conditions amplify downstream health impacts. By integrating data from provincial wildfire records, air quality and pollutant monitoring, weather observations, and public health indicators, the analysis takes a holistic view of how environmental and health systems interact during wildfire events.

Rather than analyzing these factors in isolation, the project explores how temperature, precipitation, wind, and humidity influence wildfire behaviour, how wildfires affect air quality indicators such as PM2.5 and the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI), and how changes in air quality correspond with emergency department visits for respiratory conditions. The findings aim to support better-informed public health planning, emergency response timelines, and climate adaptation strategies as wildfire seasons continue to intensify.

## Key Insights & Recommendations

### Key Insights

- Rising temperatures are the strongest driver of wildfire severity, showing a clear relationship with increased fire size and spread. While the total number of wildfires has declined over time, the fires that do occur tend to be significantly larger and more intense.

- Precipitation plays a critical mitigating role. Higher rainfall is associated with smaller fire sizes, reduced spread rates, and lower concentrations of airborne pollutants, highlighting its importance in moderating wildfire impacts.

- Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the primary contributor to poor air quality during wildfire events. Increases in PM2.5 strongly correspond with elevated AQHI levels, reinforcing its value as a key indicator for public health risk communication.

- Weather conditions amplify pollution exposure during fires. Higher temperatures and the absence of rainfall significantly increase concentrations of PM2.5 and carbon monoxide, while wind speed contributes to pollutant persistence rather than immediate dispersion.

- Public health impacts are present but not always linear. A moderate relationship was observed between wildfire activity and emergency department visits for respiratory conditions; however, air quality alone did not fully explain variations in health outcomes, suggesting additional social or behavioural factors influence health responses.

- Air quality recovery following wildfires is relatively short but consistent. AQHI levels typically return to baseline within approximately 1–1.3 days, regardless of wildfire size, indicating that fire magnitude alone is not a strong predictor of recovery time.

## Recommendations & Implications

### Prioritize temperature-driven risk planning
- Emergency preparedness and wildfire mitigation strategies should place greater emphasis on temperature trends rather than fire counts alone, as climate warming is driving more severe fire behaviour even when fewer fires occur.

### Use PM2.5 as a leading public health trigger
- Given its strong relationship with AQHI, PM2.5 should remain a primary indicator for issuing air quality advisories, school closures, and public health guidance during wildfire events.

### Incorporate short-term recovery windows into response planning
- Knowing that air quality often stabilizes within 1–2 days can help health authorities better time evacuation guidance, hospital staffing adjustments, and public advisories.

### Integrate weather forecasts into early warning systems
- Forecasted high temperatures combined with low precipitation should be treated as high-risk conditions, enabling earlier deployment of resources and proactive public messaging.
